# PathVisualizer

## This is a path visualizer made entirely in pygame
### Algorithms you can visualize:
1. A*
2. Dijkstra's
3. Breadth First Search
4. Depth First Search

### Hosted version [here](https://repl.it/@MeshanKhosla/PathVisualizer#main.py), but I highly suggest downloading the executable (if on Windows) below for optimal performce
