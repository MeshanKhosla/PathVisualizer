# PathVisualizer

## This is a path visualizer made entirely in pygame
### Algorithms you can visualize:
1. A*
2. Dijkstra's
3. Breadth First Search
4. Depth First Search

### Hosted version [here](https://repl.it/@MeshanKhosla/PathVisualizer#main.py), but I suggest downloading the executable below for ideal performance
